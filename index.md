###  Biography

I am an Assistant Professor in Harrison School of Pharmacy at Auburn University and also hold an joint appointment as
an Adjunct Assistant Professor in Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering. I am a member of 
The Omics and Informatics Cluster Hire in Auburn University. I received a BS from China majoring in Bioinformatics in 2009; a
MHS in [Biostatistics](http://www.jhsph.edu/departments/biostatistics/index.html) in 2011, from the
Johns Hopkins University; another MSE in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/) in 2011, from the
Johns Hopkins University. I joined the department right after obtaining my PhD in [Computer Science and Informatics](http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/site/home/) at Emory University in 2017.
I also interned in CareerBuilder Data Science and Amazon Machine Learning in Summer 2014 and 2015 respectively.


### Research
I am interested in data science research with its application in biomedical data especially large-scale omics data and population-based epidemiological data. I am leading a small interdisciplinary data science group that consists of four PhD students in Computer Science, Pharmaceutical Science and Biomedical Science working on bioinformatics
& biostatistics projects. My current research focuses on developing statistical and informatics methods for analyzing of large-scale omics and population-based epidemiological data. Projects include but not limited to 

- **Epigenomics**: 
Develop statistical methods and database for epigenomic data in differential biological conditions.
	- [Differential binding](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/bioinformatics/btv094). [<a href="http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/ChIPComp.html">Link to ChIPComp</a>]
	- [Database and web server](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/27/10/1447/260530). [<a href="http://jilab.biostat.jhsph.edu/database/cgi-bin/hmChIP.pl">Link to hmChIP</a>]

- **Genetics**:
Develop computational methods for annotating and predicting functional variants (GWAS SNPs, cis-eQTL SNVs) by utilizing large-scale multi-omics profiles. 
	- [GWAS variant enrichment analysis](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/32/8/1214/1744655). [<a href="http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/traseR.html">Link to traseR</a>]
